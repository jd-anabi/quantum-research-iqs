Code relating to student research for the Institute of Quantum Studies, Chapman University. 

# Theory-independent Benchmarking of Quantum Devices
Working with Dr. Matthew Leifer for Chapman’s IQS in quantum foundations research and performing experiments using the IBM quantum experience. Implemented quadratic programs, tomographic schemes, heuristic algorithms, and designed quantum circuits using gates in an attempt to determine which set of GPTs (generalized probabilistic theories) work within a specific set of experimental data.

# Testing the Reality of the Quantum State
Working with Dr. Matthew Leifer for Chapman’s IQS in quantum foundations research and testing whether the quantum state represents a state of reality or a state of knowledge. To this end, we worked with the IBM quantum experience to compute a bound for the ratio between the classical overlap and the quantum overlap.
